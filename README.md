## What I learned

I started to understand Vue.js a little more, since I don't develop much with Vue.js, I learned and reinforced what I already knew, passing props, event components, watchers, references, although I think I still have a lot to learn about Vue.js.

## Technologies used in the project 
- Vue.js
- CSS
- Vite
